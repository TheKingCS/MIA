# MIA Decisions

*The decision log (format and rules: `docs/COLLABORATION.md`). Only Zac
approves. A decision is never deleted: it becomes SUPERSEDED or
REJECTED. Seeded 2026-10-05 from decisions already made and recorded in
`docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/NEXT_SESSION.md` and
`docs/ENGINE_PHASE1_PLAN.md`.*

### DEC-0001: MIA is built for anyone; each person's data is their own
- Status: IMPLEMENTED
- Proposed by: claude, 2026-10-01 · Approved by: zac, 2026-10-01
- Decision: MIA is perfected for personal use but designed for any
  person or household. People sign in with an email; nothing is shared
  unless they join a household with a member's approval. Child accounts
  are looked after by a parent.
- Why: hundreds of different people may use MIA.
- Related: `core/personal_data.py`, `core/household_manager.py`,
  `core/child_accounts.py`

### DEC-0002: Real personal data never goes in the repo
- Status: IMPLEMENTED
- Proposed by: claude, 2026-10-05 · Reviewed by: chatgpt · Approved by: zac, 2026-10-05
- Decision: no real personal data in code, specs, mock-ups, prompts,
  tests or seed files. It enters through MIA itself (or a local,
  git-ignored `data/seed.json`) and stays on the device. Shared material
  uses placeholders.
- Why: MIA should know a person's life because they told it, not
  because a developer hardcoded it; git history is permanent.
- Related: DEC-0001, `docs/ENGINE_PHASE1_PLAN.md` §4a

### DEC-0003: Extend and connect what exists; don't rebuild from the mock-up
- Status: APPROVED
- Proposed by: claude, 2026-10-05 · Reviewed by: chatgpt · Approved by: zac, 2026-10-05
- Decision: the repo already holds the engine. Work connects and
  extends it, and keeps the existing architecture unless there's a real
  limitation.
- Why: the gap was between the engine and the designed interface, not
  missing features.
- Related: DEC-0005, `docs/ENGINE_PHASE1_PLAN.md`

### DEC-0004: Facts in code; the language model only phrases and proposes
- Status: IMPLEMENTED
- Proposed by: zac/claude, 2026-09 · Approved by: zac
- Decision: totals, dates, permissions, XP, scheduling, validation and
  safety are deterministic code. The model reasons over structured
  memory and is never the memory. Crisis handling never depends on it.
- Why: a small local model is unreliable at facts; safety must not
  depend on it.

### DEC-0005: Every surface consumes MIA through one read model
- Status: IMPLEMENTED
- Proposed by: chatgpt, 2026-10-05 · Reviewed by: claude · Approved by: zac, 2026-10-05
- Decision: the desktop, phone, Android app, design mock-ups, glasses,
  voice and future AR all read the same Life State
  (`/api/state`, `docs/schema/life_state.schema.json`). None of them is
  a separate implementation of MIA.
- Why: one coherent MIA; no screen invents its own interpretation.
- Related: DEC-0007, `core/context_assembler.py`, `docs/HANDOFFS/H-0003_claude-to-muse_where-mia-is.md`

### DEC-0006: History sits beside the stores (no event-sourcing rewrite)
- Status: IMPLEMENTED
- Proposed by: claude, 2026-10-05 · Reviewed by: chatgpt · Approved by: zac, 2026-10-05
- Decision: the existing stores stay the source of truth for the
  current state; `core/life_events.py` is an append-only history beside
  them; `core/links.py` holds relationships by reference, never as a
  copy.
- Why: rewriting ~30 working stores and their tests for theoretical
  event sourcing would risk everything for little gain.
- Related: DEC-0003, `docs/ENGINE_PHASE1_PLAN.md` §8

### DEC-0007: Status taxonomy on every capability
- Status: IMPLEMENTED
- Proposed by: muse (kickoff spec), 2026-10-05 · Approved by: zac, 2026-10-05
- Decision: every section, service and export is labeled REAL, DERIVED,
  SIMULATED, STATIC or PLANNED. No UI implies a capability the engine
  doesn't have.
- Why: honesty about what MIA can really do.
- Related: DEC-0005, the schema

### DEC-0008: The 10-question guardrail for every proposal
- Status: APPROVED
- Proposed by: chatgpt, 2026-10-05 · Approved by: zac, 2026-10-05
- Decision: every new screen or feature is run through the ten
  questions in `docs/COLLABORATION.md` before it's built.
- Why: stops design and engine drifting apart.
- Related: `docs/ENGINE_PHASE1_PLAN.md` §9

### DEC-0009: Read, propose, approve: no silent actions
- Status: IMPLEMENTED
- Proposed by: zac/claude · Approved by: zac
- Decision: MIA proposes and the person decides. Email is only drafted
  and is sent only when a person presses Send. Assistant changes are
  undoable. Unprompted messages go through the communication gate
  (daily limit, no repeats, "why did you tell me that?").
- Why: trust; the person stays in charge of their life.
- Related: `core/communication_gate.py`, `core/undo_log.py`, `core/email_drafts.py`

### DEC-0010: The AIs collaborate through shared files in the repo, not directly
- Status: APPROVED
- Proposed by: chatgpt and zac, 2026-10-05 · Reviewed by: claude · Approved by: zac, 2026-10-05
- Decision: a persistent shared project memory (this file,
  `COLLABORATION.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `QUESTIONS.md`, `HANDOFFS/`)
  replaces Zac relaying messages. No AI-to-AI connection. Start with
  files in the repo; a website on top is a later option (Q-0006).
- Why: simpler, auditable, works with what each AI can already reach.
- Related: DEC-0011

### DEC-0011: Make the MIA repo public so ChatGPT can read it
- Status: PROPOSED
- Proposed by: zac, 2026-10-05 · Reviewed by: claude (privacy audit, 2026-10-05)
- Decision: switch `github.com/TheKingCS/MIA` from private to public.
- Why: ChatGPT can only read public repos.
- Audit (claude, all 373 commits): no API keys, tokens, passwords,
  addresses, account or loan details, and no personal data files were
  ever committed. What would become public: all code and docs; the first
  names Zac and Faith and the household truck model in tests, comments
  and the roadmap; Zac's personal email as the author of about 50
  commits. There is no LICENSE file, which means "all rights reserved"
  (people can read it but not reuse it).
- Waiting on: Zac (Q-0005).
